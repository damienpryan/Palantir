[START CONTEXT]

Here's some ongoing context about my project and setup:

**Project Goal:** Setting up an LLM (Large Language Model) on a home machine for personal use and development.

**Portability Strategy:**
* **Primary Goal:** To ensure extreme ease of migration to new machines.
* **Methodology:** Everything will be managed via **GitHub** and deployed using **Docker containers**.

**LLM Status:**
* Currently using a Google API key for LLM access.
* **Future Plan:** May transition to using a local, home-based LLM model.
* **Current Progress:** Have successfully completed a proof-of-concept (PoC) using a single-session Flask application integrated with LangChain.

**Development Environment:**
* **Current:** Working on an Ubuntu Virtual Machine (VM) running on a laptop.
* **Future Plan:** Acquiring and setting up a dedicated home server for this project.

**Infrastructure & Deployment:**
* **Home Server Plan:** Will be the primary host for the LLM and related services.
* **Website:** Planning to run a website on the home server.
* **Security:** Leveraging Cloudflare for website security (no public IP address will be exposed directly from the home server).
* **Containerization:** Will be extensively using Docker for containerizing applications and services.
* **Version Control:** Utilizing Git/GitHub for all code management and version control.

**Learning Focus:**
* **Key Learning Area:** Need to learn and become proficient with **GitHub** (as accustomed to older systems like RCS).

**Other considerations:**

Stack plan:
1. Core Components & Their Docker Homes:

Nginx (Web Server / Reverse Proxy)

Docker Container: A dedicated container running the Nginx image.
Role: This will be your application's entry point from the outside world (or Cloudflare). It will serve static files (HTML, CSS, JS) directly and act as a reverse proxy, forwarding dynamic web requests to your Flask application.
Files:
nginx/Dockerfile (optional, often just uses base Nginx image)
nginx/nginx.conf (configuration for reverse proxying to Flask, serving static files, SSL if needed).
Flask Application (Python Web App / LangChain / LLM Interface / Image Ingestion Logic)

Docker Container: A custom container built from a Python base image.
Role: This is your main application logic. It will handle web requests from Nginx, process user input, interact with LangChain for LLM calls (Google API initially), perform image ingestion/processing, and communicate with the PostgreSQL database for chat history. It will run using a production WSGI server like Gunicorn.
Files:
app/Dockerfile (defines how to build your Python app image, including installing dependencies from requirements.txt).
app/requirements.txt (lists Python packages like Flask, LangChain, psycopg2-binary, Pillow/OpenCV, etc.).
app/main.py (or similar, your Flask application code).
app/config.py (application configuration).
PostgreSQL Database

Docker Container: A dedicated container running the official PostgreSQL image.
Role: Stores your application's persistent data, primarily chat history, user data, or any other information your Flask app needs to save.
Files:
Typically uses the official PostgreSQL Docker image directly, so no custom Dockerfile is usually needed.
Database configurations and initial scripts can be mounted as volumes or set via environment variables in docker-compose.yml.
2. Orchestration with Docker Compose:

All these services will be defined and managed in a single docker-compose.yml file at the root of your palproj directory. This file declares your services, their images, ports, volumes, environment variables, and network dependencies.
A single docker compose up -d command will start all three services in their own isolated containers, connected on an internal Docker network.
3. Inter-Container Communication:

Nginx to Flask: Nginx will forward requests to the Flask container using its service name (e.g., http://flask_app:8000) within the Docker Compose network. Gunicorn will be listening on a port inside the Flask container (e.g., 8000).
Flask to PostgreSQL: The Flask application will connect to the PostgreSQL container using its service name (e.g., postgresql_db:5432) within the Docker Compose network, along with credentials.
External Access: Only the Nginx container's port 80 (and 443 for HTTPS) will be exposed to your host machine's network. All other containers communicate internally and are not directly exposed to the outside.
4. Cloudflare Integration:

Cloudflare will point to your home server's public IP (which Nginx will be listening on) or use a tunnel if you have no public IP.
Nginx will receive requests from Cloudflare (which handles initial security and DDoS protection).
Your nginx.conf will be configured to handle these requests and pass them to Flask.
5. Future Consideration (Local LLM):

If you transition to a local LLM (e.g., using Ollama or a Hugging Face model server), this would ideally be another separate Docker container.
Your Flask application (LangChain) would then communicate with this local LLM container (e.g., http://local_llm_service:11434 for Ollama) instead of the external Google API. This keeps your LLM model isolated and easily swappable.
Project Structure within ~/palproj (Example):

palproj/
├── app/
│   ├── Dockerfile             # Builds your Flask application image
│   ├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
│   ├── main.py                # Your Flask app code
│   └── (other Flask files, templates, static, etc.)
├── nginx/
│   └── nginx.conf             # Nginx configuration
├── .gitignore                 # Files Git should ignore (e.g., .env, __pycache__)
├── docker-compose.yml         # Defines and links all your Docker services
└── AI_CONTEXT.md              # Your context file

This setup provides a highly modular, portable, and maintainable foundation for your project, allowing each component to be developed, updated, and scaled independently.

The QAD LLM Project Stack (Proposed & Complete)
Here's the comprehensive list of the Docker services we'll be using:

cloudflare-tunnel (Cloudflare cloudflared container)

Purpose: Establishes a secure, outbound-only tunnel from your host machine to the Cloudflare network. It allows Cloudflare to route external traffic to your nginx container without exposing your home server's public IP address or opening inbound ports.
nginx

Purpose: The web server and reverse proxy. It receives secure traffic from the cloudflare-tunnel and forwards it to your app container, while also serving any static website content.
app_db (PostgreSQL)

Purpose: Your traditional relational database, dedicated to storing application data like user sessions, chat history, or any other transactional data from your Flask application.
vector_db (PostgreSQL with pgvector)

Purpose: A dedicated PostgreSQL instance, specifically optimized for storing and performing similarity searches on the numerical embeddings (vectors) of your OpenEdge code. This is the core knowledge base for the LLM.
ingestion (Python Application)

Purpose: A standalone, batch-oriented application that pulls your OpenEdge code from Git, processes it, converts it into embeddings, and loads these embeddings into the vector_db.
app (Python Flask Application with LangChain)

Purpose: Your main Flask web application. It handles user requests, orchestrates calls to the vector_db for relevant code context, sends prompts to the Gemini LLM, and manages application-specific data in app_db.
Data Flow: How QAD Code Becomes LLM Knowledge (Complete, with Cloudflare)
The flow of data, particularly your OpenEdge code, can be broken down into two main phases, with Cloudflare acting as the secure gateway:

Phase 1: Ingestion (Building the Knowledge Base)

This phase happens offline or on a scheduled basis to populate and update the vector_db.

Source Code (Git Repository):

Your OpenEdge .p and custom .i files reside in a dedicated Git repository. This repository is the definitive source of truth for your QAD codebase.
ingestion Container Activation:

The ingestion Docker container is started (either manually, via a scheduled cron job, or a Git webhook).
Action: Inside the container, the Python script first performs a git clone or git pull operation to fetch the absolute latest version of your OpenEdge code from the Git repository.
Code Processing (ingestion script):

Reading & Filtering: The script reads through the cloned .p and custom .i files. It applies logic to identify relevant files and potentially their relationships (e.g., which .p files INCLUDE which .i files).
Chunking: The code is broken down into smaller, semantically meaningful "chunks." This is where the OpenEdge-aware splitting logic (e.g., splitting by PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, or specific code blocks) comes into play, along with overlaps to maintain context.
Metadata Extraction: For each chunk, relevant metadata is extracted (e.g., original filename, procedure name, a flag indicating if it's an include file).
Embedding Generation: Each text chunk is sent to Google's text-embedding-004 API. This API converts the text into a high-dimensional numerical vector (embedding) that captures its semantic meaning.
Storage (vector_db):

The ingestion script connects to the vector_db (your dedicated PostgreSQL with pgvector).
Action: It inserts each chunk's original text, its extracted metadata, and its newly generated numerical embedding into the pgvector table within vector_db.
Outcome: The vector_db now holds a searchable, semantically rich representation of your entire QAD codebase.
Phase 2: Query & Response (Interacting with the LLM via Cloudflare)

This phase happens in real-time when a user asks a question via your external domain.

External Request (Cloudflare DNS & Tunnel):

A user accesses your application via your Cloudflare-managed domain (e.g., your-qad-llm.com). Cloudflare's DNS directs traffic to its edge network.
cloudflare-tunnel (on your server): This Docker container maintains an active, secure outbound connection to Cloudflare's edge. When Cloudflare receives a request for your domain, it forwards it through this established tunnel directly to your nginx container.
Web Server (nginx):

Action: nginx receives the request from the Cloudflare tunnel. It either serves static files directly (e.g., your index.html) or, for API/app requests, acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding them to your app container.
User Query (app):

The app (Flask application) receives the user's query (e.g., "How does order_entry.p handle inventory adjustments?").
Query Embedding (app):

Action: It sends this user query to Google's text-embedding-004 API (the same embedding model used during ingestion) to convert the query into its own numerical embedding.
Semantic Search (vector_db):

The app sends the user query's embedding to the vector_db.
Action: vector_db performs a similarity search (using pgvector) to find the most relevant code chunks in its database. It looks for stored code embeddings that are numerically "closest" to the query embedding, indicating semantic similarity.
Outcome: vector_db returns the top N most relevant code chunks (their original text and metadata) back to the app.
Contextualized Prompt (app & Gemini):

The app (using LangChain) takes the user's original query and combines it with the retrieved relevant code chunks. This forms a comprehensive "contextualized prompt."
Action: This combined prompt is then sent to the Google Gemini Pro LLM API.
LLM Response (Gemini):

Action: The Gemini Pro LLM processes the contextualized prompt. It uses its vast knowledge and the specific code context provided to understand the query and generate a coherent, accurate, and helpful answer.
Outcome: The LLM sends its generated answer back to the app.
Display & History (app & app_db):

The app receives the LLM's answer.
Action: It displays the answer to the user through the web interface (served back through nginx and the cloudflare-tunnel). Optionally, it also saves the user's query and the LLM's response into the app_db (PostgreSQL) for chat history, ensuring a separate record of interactions.
This revised walkthrough truly completes the end-to-end data flow, integrating Cloudflare as your secure front door. It should be perfect for updating your project plan!

[END CONTEXT]


FRONT END PLAN:
Okay, understood. The user uploading a program they are working on for ad-hoc analysis (not for bulk codebase ingestion via Git) is a key clarification. This means the file upload is for temporary, user-specific context for the RAG, rather than permanent knowledge base updates.

Here's the refined frontend plan in a format you can add to your project documentation, incorporating all the discussed points:

Frontend Project Plan (QAD LLM Project)
1. Project Goal:
To provide a spartan, functional web interface for the OpenEdge RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, enabling user interaction with the LLM, context provision through code/image uploads, and download of generated or retrieved content.

2. Frontend Technology Stack:

Primary: Plain HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This choice aligns with the "spartan" requirement and offers maximum control for implementing specific file/image handling features.
Serving: Nginx will exclusively serve all static frontend assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from its /usr/share/nginx/html directory, mapped from palproj/nginx/html.
Future Considerations: If the complexity of the UI or the need for component reusability increases significantly, a lightweight JavaScript framework (e.g., Alpine.js, htmx, or even a minimal Vue.js setup) could be considered, but the current focus is on essential functionality with minimal overhead.
3. Core Frontend Functionalities:

* **RAG Query Interface:**
    * A prominent text input area for users to type their OpenEdge-related queries.
    * A dynamic display area to present the LLM's generated answers and potentially the retrieved code chunks that informed the answer.
* **Ad-hoc Code/File Upload for Context:**
    * A dedicated section with a "Browse File" button and/or a drag-and-drop zone.
    * Allows users to upload individual OpenEdge program files (`.p`, `.w`, `.t`, `.i`) or other relevant text-based documents that they are currently working on.
    * **Purpose:** These files are uploaded to provide *immediate, temporary context* for the current RAG session, allowing the LLM to consider the user's specific work-in-progress code in its response. This is distinct from the bulk ingestion process handled by the `ingestion` service, which builds the permanent vector database from the Git repository.
    * Upon upload, these files will be sent to a new Flask endpoint (e.g., `/app/upload_context`) for processing (e.g., temporary storage, chunking, and immediate embedding for the current query, or short-term session-based vector storage).
* **Image-to-Text (OCR) Feature:**
    * A designated area where users can paste images directly (from clipboard) or drop image files.
    * Client-side JavaScript will capture the image data from `paste` or `drop` events.
    * The image data will be sent to a new Flask endpoint (e.g., `/app/ocr`).
    * **Purpose:** The backend will perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the image and return the extracted text. This extracted text is *not* for embedding into the long-term knowledge base but rather to populate the main RAG query input field, allowing the user to easily submit text from an image as part of their query. *No complex image analysis or object recognition is required or intended.*
* **File Download Functionality:**
    * **Generated Content Download:** Provide clickable links or buttons to download code snippets, configuration files, or summarized reports generated by the LLM.
    * **Retrieved Original Source Code Download:** Allow users to download the full original OpenEdge source files that were identified as relevant by the RAG system. This would enable users to examine the complete context of a retrieved code chunk directly. This would involve the Flask `app` serving these files from the `CODE_REPO_PATH` volume mount.
4. User Authentication and Context (Future Phase):

* Implementation of user login and logout forms.
* Frontend management of authentication tokens or session identifiers to enable context remembering for individual users. This will involve storing session details in `app_db`.
5. Interface Design Philosophy:

* **Spartan and Functional:** The primary focus is on clear layout and intuitive interaction for the core RAG, ad-hoc file context, and image-to-text functionalities. Visual aesthetics will be minimal.
* **Usability:** Components will be designed for ease of use, ensuring a straightforward workflow for querying, providing context, and retrieving information.
6. Development Workflow:

* Frontend static files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, etc.) will reside directly within the `palproj/nginx/html` directory.
* Development iterations will involve directly modifying these files and refreshing the browser to see changes.
* All API calls from the frontend JavaScript (`app.js`) will target the Flask application via Nginx, using paths like `/app/chat/`, `/app/upload_context`, `/app/ocr`, and `/app/download/`. Nginx will act as the reverse proxy, forwarding these requests to the `app` Docker container.
